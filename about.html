            Programming is a skill that I have been working to learn for many
            years. After being introduced to the concept of writing algorithims
            and sequential programming in 10th grade, I went on to choose
            computer science as a major at College. I have no work experience
            within the Technology Industry, but I have a passion for learning
            the different tech stacks there are to use as most of my knowledge
            is self taught.

            During my time here, I learned alot about the basics of programming

            be found in the project section.
